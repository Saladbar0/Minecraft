    <p>
      <font size = "5px">The Wither is an optional side boss in Minecraft, which is ironic, because it is considered to be the hardest boss in the game. Once it is defeated, the player gains access to one main item:</font>
      <li>
        <font size = "4px">Beacons/Trivia<br /></font>
          </li>
          <ul>
          <font size = "4px">Beacons are a staple part of endgame gear. A beacon allows the player to choose a positive buff to constantly have when within range of the beacon, so the beacon really helps out in the endgame<br />
            To form a beacon, the player must build a pyramid out of material blocks, such as Iron, Gold, Diamonds, and if you spend enough time, even Netherite. The material does not matter, but the beacon can be <br />
            anywhere from a 3x3 square base, to a 9x9 square base with the beacon at the top. So it's safe to say that beacons are valuable, but expensive. <br />The Wither can be summoned using 4 blocks of soul sand and 3 Wither Skeleton Skulls that can be obtained from the Wither Skeleton at a 1/100 drop chance.</font>
